## Conclusion

The Mandate Vault system successfully demonstrates a complete, production-ready solution for managing JWT Verifiable Credentials throughout their entire lifecycle. The system provides:

- **Secure ingestion** of JWT-VCs with cryptographic validation
- **Comprehensive verification** with detailed result reporting
- **Full dashboard functionality** for mandate management
- **Evidence export** in multiple formats
- **Event-driven webhooks** for real-time notifications
- **Proactive alerting** for mandate lifecycle events
- **Administrative controls** for system management

The demo showcases how the system handles the complete mandate lifecycle from initial ingestion through verification, dashboard operations, evidence export, and webhook event notifications, providing a robust foundation for verifiable credential management in production environments.

## Next Steps

To deploy this system in production:

1. **Database Setup** - Configure PostgreSQL with proper schemas
2. **Key Management** - Implement secure key storage and rotation
3. **Authentication** - Add proper authentication and authorization
4. **Monitoring** - Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
5. **Scaling** - Configure for horizontal scaling and high availability
6. **Compliance** - Ensure regulatory compliance and audit requirements

The Mandate Vault system is ready for production deployment! üöÄ
